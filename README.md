## bin

Here are some runnable file.

You can use this file by run these command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:{The path that you put the bin floder}
```

For example, if the path of this floder is `/home/xxxx/ToolBox/bin`. You need to run this command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/xxxx/ToolBox/bin
```

After run these, you can type the name of the file to run it for temporary(I will list what you can use under this). If you want to use it for a while, you might add this command to the `~/.profile`.

## source

The code of the runable file.

You can help me to improve it or customize it :)

You can compile it in your computer if you can't run the program in 'bin'.
